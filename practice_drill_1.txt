Directory Structure:

hello
├── five
│   └── six
│       ├── c.txt
│       └── seven
│           └── error.log
└── one
    ├── a.txt
    ├── b.txt
    └── two
        ├── d.txt

            ├── e.txt
            └── four
                └── access.log
                

To create above directory structure, following commands are used:

---- here i'm creating dir and files through pwd ----

2. cd hello
3. mkdir five one
4. cd five
5. mkdir six
6. cd six
7. touch c.txt
8. mkdir seven
9. cd seven
10. touch error.log

---- here i'm creating dir and files only from hello dir----
11. touch one/a.txt one/b.txt
12. mkdir one/two
13. touch one/two/d.txt
14. mkdir one/two/three
15. touch one/two/three/e.txt
16. mkdir one/two/three/four
17. touch one/two/three/access.log

Question & Answers:

1. Delete all the files having the .log extension

    - cmd: 
    		find . -type f -name '*.log' -exec rm -rf {} \;
    		
    - explanation: 
    		    find - finds what we are looking recursively in dir and sub dir
    		    . - current dir
    		    -type f - we are searching file (not dir)
    		    -name '*.log' - we are searching for a file who ends with .log , * is wildcard character, which represents one or more characters should be present in place of *
    		    -exec - execute further commands on result of find cmd
    		    rm - remove file 
    		    -rf - remove recursively and forcefully
    		    {} - where .log file finds by find cmd, it's path replaced with {}
    		    \; - end of -exec cmd
    

2. Add the following content to a.txt
	Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
	
	-cmd:
		- Using echo: 
			echo "Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others" > a.txt
	
		- Using xclip: 
			xclip -selection clipboard -o > a.txt
		
	- explanation: 
		echo cmd used to display text on terminal and also used create/overwrite files or append to file.
		xclip is command line utility to interact with x11 clipboard system in Linux. we can copy text from others files/web sites/apps and paste it on terminal. we can copy whole file's content to clipboard
	
	- We can use nano or vi editors also
	
	
3. Delete the directory named five

	- cmd: 
		rm -r five
		
	- explanation: 
		rm used for remove file or dir . -r used when we are trying to delete a dir which is not empty, so -r recursively deletes all subdir and files


4. Rename the one directory to uno

	- cmd: 
		mv one uno
		
	- explanation: 
		there is no command present for rename, we can use mv command to move all contents of particular file/dir to other. for rename we can use just different name of destination


5. Move a.txt to the two directory

	- cmd: 
		mv a.txt ./two/
		
	- explanation:
